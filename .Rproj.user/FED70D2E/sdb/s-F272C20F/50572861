A record of the analyses that I've done, with full details of the statistical\nresults.  More details can be shown on request\n2. Snippets that can be copied and pasted into manuscripts.  (Note the abstract \nis at the end because the numbers in the abstract rely on code occurs earlier in\nthis file.)\n\nAll analyses were performed using **R**, ver. `r r_ver` [@R15] with packages \nrms, ver. `r info$otherPkgs$rms$Version` [@rms15] for  analysis; \nGmisc, ver. `r info$otherPkgs$Gmisc$Version` for plot and table output; and \nknitr, ver `r info$otherPkgs$knitr$Version` [@xie14] for reproducible research.\n\n## Reproducible research\nThis file is automatically generated, i.e. all the in-text numbers, tables and\ngraphs are generated from the data.  If the data file changes, or we decide to \nanalyse a different subset of the data, or include or exclude certain variables,\nthe content in  the document will change automatically (almost), i.e. without\nthe need to re-type anything.\n\n\"Weaving\" text, code and results together and rendering them into a document is \nknown as \"reproducible research\", i.e. there is code in the source file that \nreads the data and performs the analysis, then generates the document. This \nmakes your research report more tightly bound to the data, and makes it less \nlikely that you will be unable to reproduce or extend your research in the \nfuture if the need arises (as it often does, in my experience). You can open \nthe file with the same name as this one, but the extension \".Rmd\" \nto see the  source file which is compiled into HTML by **R**. \n\nThis approach can also generate PDF (which some journals accept), but as yet \nthere is no one-step  method for rendering directly to an editable format, e.g. \nodt, rtf or docx. But  it's easy to simply copy and paste from your web-browser \ninto your word-processor. But of course you should not do this until everyone\ninvolved  with the manuscript preparation is happy that the results are 100% \nfinalised!\n\n## Data Setup\nThe **R** code below is just to show which data file is being used.\n\n```{r label=\"read-data\", echo=2:4, size=\"small\", prompt=FALSE, cache=TRUE}\nrequire(foreign)\ndir  <- \"/home/john/Dropbox/Research/Collaboration/BEATS/John/W2S\"\n#file <- \"BEATS_SS_ForWalk2School_150507.sav\"\nfile <- \"BEATS_SS_ForWalk2School_160201_COMPLETEdata.sav\"\ndat <- read.spss( paste(dir, file, sep=\"/\"), to.data.frame=TRUE )\nrm(dir, file )\n```\n\n\n```{r label=data-setup, results='hide', cache=FALSE}\nsource( \"data-setup-W2S.R\" )\n```\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe know from previous work (and common sense!) that the most influential \ncorrelate is distance from school. But once that is factored out, what else is \ninfluential?\n\n```{r label=ATS-Dist, dependson=\"data-setup\", fig.cap=\"Figure 1: Empirical probability of ATS by distance from school\", fig.align='center'}\nemp <- NULL\nplot_cutoff <- 10000\n\nwith( dat.full[ dat.full$Dist2School <= plot_cutoff, ],\n      {\n        for ( i in 1:length(Dist2School ) ) \n           emp[i] <- prop.table(table(ATS_f[ Dist2School < Dist2School[i]]))[\"Walk\"]\n        emp_prob <- data.frame( dist=Dist2School, true=ATS_f, prob=emp )\n        p <- ggplot( emp_prob, aes( dist, prob) ) \n        p <- p + labs(x=\"Distance to school (m)\", y=\"Probability of Walking to School\" )\n        p <- p + geom_point(size=1) \n        p <- p + geom_smooth( size=1, method=\"gam\", formula= y ~ s( x, bs = \"cs\") )\n        p <- p + annotate(\"text\", label=\"Optimal distance\\nthreshold: ≤ 2,200m\\nSensitivity: 84%\\nSpecificity: 84%\\nAUC: 93%\", x=4000, y=0.8, hjust=\"l\")\n        p <- p + geom_vline(xintercept=2200) \n        print(p)\n        }\n      )\n```\n\nThe figure above shows the empirical probability of walking to school, i.e. the \nproportion of respondents walk at each level of distance to school. The \nobservations plotted are those respondents who live less than \n`r I(format(plot_cutoff, big.mark=\",\"))`m from school to make the plot more interpretable. The blue \nline is a Generalised Additive Model smoother.  \n\n```{r walkstats, results='asis', cache=FALSE}\nwalk_min <- 469 \nwalk_50  <- 3100\nwalk_max <- 5800 \n\ntmp <- dat$ATS_f[dat$Dist2School <= walk_min]\nwalk_min_n <- sum(table(tmp))\n\ntmp <- dat$ATS_f[dat$Dist2School <= walk_50  ]\nwalk_50_n  <- sum(table(tmp))\n\ntmp <- dat$ATS_f[dat$Dist2School > walk_max  ]\nwalk_max_n <- sum(table(tmp))\n```\n\nOf the  `r I(walk_min_n)` students who live less than `r I(walk_min)`m from \nschool, all  walk to school. Of the `r I(walk_50_n)` who live less than \n`r I(walk_50)`m, 50% walk.  Finally, of the `r I(walk_max_n)` students who live\nmore than `r I(walk_max)`m from school, none of them walk to school.\n\n# Sample description\n\n## Exclusion of cases and missing value analysis\n\nThe analyses below are restricted to the students who are not boarders. There are\n`r I(format(dim(dat.ats)[ 1 ], big.mark=\",\"))` students who fit those criteria. \nThe table below shows the number of missing values on variables to be included \nin the multivariate  analyses, which reduce the available sample size.\n\n<center>\n```{r mva, dependson=\"data-setup\", cache=FALSE}\n# 2 obs  (9078, 9038) had missing aGender but non-missing gender; and missing \n# age_cat but non-missing school year, DOB_day, DOB year ats.

Not all students\nconsented to, or had time available for, anthropometry, so many of these values \nare missing. It's not clear to me why there are so many missing values for the \nother variables though.\n\nA total of `r I(fmt(dim(dat.ats)[ 1 ]))` adolescents were \nincluded in the analysis (Age\n`r I(round(mean(dat.ats$Age_at_Survey, na.rm=T),1))` ± \n`r I(round(sd(dat.ats$Age_at_Survey, na.rm=T),1))` years; \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$gender)),1)[\"Male\"])`% boys; \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$eth3)),1)[\"NZ European\"])`% New Zealand European; \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$BMI_f)),1)[\"Normal\"])`% normal weight). \nThe most common modes of transport to school was being driven by others \n(`r I(sum(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$TscCarOth)),1)[4:5]))`%) \nfollowed by walking \n(`r I(sum(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$TscWalk)),1)[4:5]) )`%), \nschool bus (`r I(sum(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$TscBusSc)),1)[4:5]))`%), \npublic bus (`r I(sum(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$TscBusPub)),1)[4:5]))`%)\nand driving themselves \n(`r I(sum(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$TscCarMy)),1)[4:5]))`%).\nOverall, \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$ATS)),1)[1])`%\nof adolescents used motorized transport only, \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$ATS)),1)[2])`% \nW2S, and \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$ATS)),1)[3])`% \nused a combination of motorized and active transport to school. Most students \n(`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$TSlike)),1)[\"Yes\"])`%) \nliked the way they travelled to school. \n\n\n## Potential correlates \nSocio-demographic characteristics of students who walked versus did not walk to \nschool are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4.\n\n<center>\n```{r label=\"descriptives-demos\", cache=FALSE}\nrequire( Gmisc )\nn.w  <- table(dat.ats$ATS_f)[2]\nn.dw <- table(dat.ats$ATS_f)[1]\nres  <- data_setup( dat.ats,  \"ATS_f\", c(\"Age_at_Survey\", \"gender\", \"eth3\", \n                                         \"BMI_2cat\", \"cars3\", \"NZDepCat3\", \n                                         \"tsdecision\",\"Dist2School\"))\n(tab1 <- htmlTable(x = res$tab,\n  rgroup   = res$rgroup,\n  n.rgroup = res$ngroup,\n  label    = \"Table1\",\n  caption  = \"Demographic characteristics of the sample.\",\n  tfoot    = \"<small><sup>&dagger;</sup>Categorical variables are reported in counts and percentages: count (%).

This model was reduced by removing the correlate \nwith the largest *p*-value one at a time and re-inspecting the fit carefully. \n\nThis was not a purely automatic or data-driven process. At each stage, the \nconceptual meaning of the candidate variable for removal was considered.  During \nthis process, it became apparent that two of the correlates, **time** and \n**intention** are highly correlated with distance and with each other, even though \ntheir VIFs are well below 10. Also these variables have little explanatory power \nconceptually. Accordingly they were removed at the earliest stage of model \nsimplification.\n\n```{r ATS-m1, dependson=c(\"read-data\"), results='hide', cache=TRUE}\noptions( contrasts=c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.treatment\"))\ndat.m1   <- dat.ats[ complete.cases(dat.ats), ]\nm1.ddist <- datadist(dat.m1)\noptions(datadist=\"m1.ddist\")\nm1 <- robcov(lrm(ATS_f ~ rcs( Dist2School, knots=3)\n          + BMI_f + n_cars + NZDepCat3 + school_decile_n \n          + whodecides + control + schiclose \n          + interesting + pleasant + boring + useful + safe + exercise \n          + onway + stuff + sched + planning + sweaty + unsafe + tired \n          + desire + confd \n          + adults + parents_walk + parents_safe \n          + parents_say + friends_say + school_says + cool + friends_dont \n          + weather + hills + regwalk \n          + NEStConnect + NGEsthetics, \n          x=T, y=T, data=dat.m1 ), dat.m1$school)\nm1.gof <- LR.summary( m1, html = T, anova=F )\n```\n\n<center>\n```{r m1_gof, cache=FALSE}\nhtmlTable(m1.gof$sf, \n          rnames=F, \n          align=\"r\", \n          header=c(\"Index\", \"<span style='padding:5mm'/>\", \"Statistic\", \"<span style='padding:5mm'/>\"), \n          caption=\"Inital model goodness of fit and summary information\")\n```\n</center>\n\n\n<center>\n```{r m1_anova, results='asis'}\n#aov2html( m1 )\n```\n</center>\n  \n## Model 2\nThe variables that survived this process and remained significant at the 5% \nlevel are shown below, in model 2.

(**NB**: currently this is set rather low, so that this file will\ncompile  quickly.

It also has good face \nvalidity. Apart from the obvious effect of distance\n(`r I(OR.inline(OR(m_final, Dist2School=c(4000,5000))[\"Dist2School\",], 3))`), \nlogistical factors: \n\n- school being on the way to somewhere else,(**onway**, OR `r I(OR.print(m_final, \"onway\", 2))`) most probably work, or the school of a sibling) and\n\n- the difficulty of fitting walking into the student's after-school schedule (**sched**, OR `r I(OR.print(m_final, \"sched\", 2))`)\n\n- planning for walking to school (**planning**, OR `r I(OR.print(m_final, \"planning\", 2))`)\n\ndecrease the likelihood of walking to school. However social and lifestyle factors:\n\n- peer approval (**cool**, OR `r I(OR.print(m_final, \"cool\", 2))`), \n\n- having parental support or encouragement to walk (**parents_say**, OR `r I(OR.print(m_final, \"parents_say\", 2))`)\n\n- being a walker for general mobility (**regwalk**, OR `r I(OR.print(m_final, \"regwalk\", 2))`), and\n\nincrease the likelihood of W2S.  Note that walking for general mobility may be\na lifestyle choice, or a function of lack of alternative mobility options. \nHowever the correlation between **regwalk** and **n_cars** is only \n`r I(with(dat.ats, myCor(n_cars, regwalk)))` \n(*p* &lt; `r I(fmt_p(with(dat.ats, cor.test(n_cars, regwalk))$p.value))`), \nwhich gives some evidence that regular walking may not be based largely or \nsolely on necessity.\n\nLastly, BMI has an effect.  The point estimates for ORs of being overweight or \nobese more than halve the odds of W2S. The normal vs. obese comparison is not \nsignificant, but this is almost certainly due to the lower number of students in \nthis category inflating the standard error, as the graphical presentation of ORs\nshows.\n\nThe final model suggests that parental factors of encouragement to walk to \nschool, and to walk for general mobility, will be the most influential factors in \npromoting walking to school among New Zealand secondary school students. If this\nencouragement was genuine, then the barriers of convenience and after-school\nschedule would not apply: students could be dropped off somewhere other than the\nschool gate in the morning, and picked up from the school in the afternoon.\nThen, at least half the time they would be walking.\n\nIt is relevant to note that there were many other \"healthy lifestyle\" factors\nthat were unrelated to walking to school. No variables in the nutrition or \nphysical activity sections of the questionnaire influence the likelihood of \nwalking, for example.\n\nAs a final comment, one may think that because distance has such a large \ninfluence on walking to school, that the additional variables in the final model \ndo not have much explanatory power in relative terms. However this is not true. \nRemoving distance to school from the final model still gives an ROC value of \n`r I(m4.gof$stats$ROC)`%, which is still outstanding.\n\n# Summary\nAll logistic regression modelling results are exceptionally good in terms of \ndiscrimination, predictive ability and face validity. \n\nBut, if time permits, I would really like to re-run these  models excluding \ndistances where either everyone walks (about 500m) or no-one  walks (about \n5000m).  That would reduce the sample size somewhat, but I feel it would also \nincrease both the substantive and statistical validity and robustness of \nmodelling results.\n\n# Abstract\n**Results**: Overall, \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$ATS)),1)[1])`%\nof adolescents in the sample used motorized transport to school, \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$ATS)),1)[2])`% \nW2S, and \n`r I(round(100*prop.table(table(dat.ats$ATS)),1)[3])`% \nused both motorized and active transport to school. Univariate correlates of W2S \nincluded perceptions of walking to school, benefits of exercise, socializing with \nfriends, perceived barriers (convenience of being driven, time constraints, \nschool bag weight, after-school schedule, planning, sweating, safety concerns, \nbeing too tired, lack of interest/desire), perceived control, number of adults \nand vehicles at home, encouragement (peers, parents, school), distance, \nperceived neighbourhood environment (land-mix use access, street connectivity, \naesthetics, hills) and weather. In a multivariate model, \npeer approval (OR [95% CI]: \n(`r I(OR.print(m_final, \"cool\", 2)) `) and parental encouragement\n(`r I(OR.print(m_final, \"parents_say\", 2))`)\nwere positively associated with W2S while incompatibility of walking with \nafter-school schedule\n(`r I( OR.print(m_final, \"sched\", 2))`)\nand convenience of being driven to school on the way to somewhere else\n(`r I(OR.print(m_final, \"onway\", 2) )`)\nwere negative factors.\n\n# References\n",
