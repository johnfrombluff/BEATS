# My BEATS Repository

## Description
This is just a playground for me to learn about **git** and **github**.  Nothing to see here, and no clever stuff to fork/steal.

## Progress on learning Git

So far, I've learned how to:

1. Initialise a local dir to an already initialised remote repository
1. Add files
1. Sync changed files
1. Delete files from the repository but *not* locally

Next: *what*?

## Progress on the project

- First revision of Panter model committed
